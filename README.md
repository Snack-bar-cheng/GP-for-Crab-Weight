# GP-for-Crab-Weight
## paper's name, Explainable models for predicting crab weight based on genetic programming.

Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidhus/crab-age-prediction

Notes:The data set uploaded in this project is cleaned data. See the paper for details.

(1) If you need to use the code, make sure to follow the configuration steps carefully.

(2) You need to configure according to the Python packages imported in 1.GPweigth.py. 
    The other three Python files (Function_Gp,evalGP_main,gp_restrict) should be placed in the same directory as 1.GPweigth.py. 
    Before conducting your experiment, make sure you have entered the correct dataset address.
